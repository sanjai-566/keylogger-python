# **Python Keylogger with GUI**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a simple yet powerful **keylogger** built using Python. It captures and logs keystrokes in real time, differentiating between **pressed, held, and released keys**. The application includes a **Tkinter-based GUI** for starting and stopping the keylogger easily. Logged keystrokes are saved in both **text (.txt) and JSON (.json) files** for further analysis.  

## **Features**  
âœ… **Real-time Keystroke Logging** â€“ Records every key press, hold, and release.  
âœ… **User-Friendly GUI** â€“ Start and stop the keylogger with a simple button click.  
âœ… **Multi-Format Data Storage** â€“ Saves keystrokes in structured JSON and text files.  
âœ… **Lightweight & Efficient** â€“ Runs in the background without slowing down the system.  
âœ… **Extensible for Ethical Use** â€“ Can be adapted for cybersecurity research, parental control, or forensic investigations.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** â€“ Core programming language  
- **Tkinter** â€“ GUI development  
- **pynput** â€“ Keyboard event tracking  
- **JSON & File Handling** â€“ Data storage  

## **Installation & Setup**  
### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/keylogger-python.git
cd keylogger-python
```
### **2. Install Required Libraries**  
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pynput
```
### **3. Run the Keylogger**  
```bash
python keylogger.py
```

## **Usage Instructions**  
1. Open the application.  
2. Click the **"Start"** button to begin keylogging.  
3. Keystrokes will be recorded and saved in `key_log.txt` and `key_log.json`.  
4. Click the **"Stop"** button to stop keylogging.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
ðŸ”¹ **Data Encryption** â€“ Securely store logged keystrokes.  
ðŸ”¹ **AI-Based Typing Analysis** â€“ Detect user behavior patterns.  
ðŸ”¹ **Remote Monitoring** â€“ Store logs in the cloud.  
ðŸ”¹ **Cross-Platform Compatibility** â€“ Extend to macOS and Linux.  

## **Legal & Ethical Disclaimer**
